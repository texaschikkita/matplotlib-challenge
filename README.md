The results show that in mice, Capomulin was able to reduce the size of tumors over time.  Ms. Mouse B128 was able to significantly reduce the size her tumor. 

While Capomulin and Ramicane both reduced tumor volume,  Capomulin showed the greatest overall decrease.

Katapil and Infubinol on the other hand were shown to cause an increase in tumor volume.

The correlation between the weight per mouse and the volume per tumor is .84.  This could indicate that the larger the mouse, the larger the tumor.  However, datmore data would be needed to make that claim accurately.
